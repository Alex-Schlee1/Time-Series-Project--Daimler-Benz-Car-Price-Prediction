### Project Goal and procedure: 
* Goal: Predict/Forecast future car sales for Daimler in the U.S. market
* Scraped previous sales data from [Goodcarbadcar.com](https://www.goodcarbadcar.net/daimler-ag-us-sales-figures/) using Python and BeautifulSoup
* Availabe data: From January, 2005- March, 2020 (183 months)
* Time Series: The Time Series method is a sequence of observations which is recorded at regular time intervals. This is the initial step before we can forecast future sales.
